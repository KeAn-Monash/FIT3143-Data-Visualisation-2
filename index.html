    <h1 class="title">World Risk Report</h1>
    <p>The WorldRiskReport is an annual technical report on global disaster 
        risks. The yearly issues of the WorldRiskReport focus on varying critical 
        topics related to disaster risk management and are published in German and 
        English. The report includes the WorldRiskIndex, which identifies the risk 
        of an extreme natural event becoming a disaster for numerous countries worldwide.
    </p>

    <p>
        The WorldRiskIndex uses 27 aggregated, publicly available indicators to determine disaster 
        risk for 181 countries worldwide. Conceptually, the index is composed of exposure to extreme 
        natural hazards and the societal vulnerability of individual countries. Earthquakes, cyclones, 
        floods, droughts, and climate-induced sea-level rise are considered in the exposure analysis. 
        Societal vulnerability is divided into susceptibility to extreme natural events, lack of coping 
        capacities, and lack of adaptive capacities. All index components are scaled to the value range 
        from 0 to 100. The higher a country's index score on the WorldRiskIndex, the higher its national 
        disaster risk. In the dataset,
        <ul>
            <li>WRI indicates the World Risk Score of the region</li>
            <li>Exposure shows the Risk/exposure to natural hazards such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, droughts, and sea level rise</li>
            <li>Vulnerability shows the Vulnerability depending on infrastructure, nutrition, housing situation, and economic framework conditions</li>
            <li>Susceptibility shows the Susceptibility depending on infrastructure, nutrition, housing situation, and economic framework conditions</li>
        </ul>
        In addition, depending on the value of the attributes above, they are divided into 5 categories: <b>Very Low</b>, <b>Low</b>, <b>Medium</b>, <b>High</b>, <b>Very high</b>.
    </p>

    <div>
        The following attributes are also considered when rating the score for different countries/regions
        <ul>
            <li>Lack of Coping Capabilities	indicates the Coping capacities in dependence of governance, preparedness and early warning, medical care, and social and material security</li>
            <li>Lack of Adaptive Capacities	indicates the Adaptive capacities related to coming natural events, climate change, and other challenges</li>
        </ul>
